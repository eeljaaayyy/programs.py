Create a list of numbers
numbers = [15, 30, 65, 80, 100]


Initialize variables for sum and count
total_sum = 0
count = 0


Iterate over the list and calculate the sum
for num in numbers:
    total_sum += num
    count += 1


Calculate the average
average = total_sum / count


Print the sum and average
print("Sum of the numbers:", total_sum)
print("Average of the numbers:", average)
